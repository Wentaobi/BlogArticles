# [Linux Kernel Teaching](https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/master/)
## This is a collection of lectures and labs Linux kernel topics. The lectures focus on theoretical and Linux kernel exploration.

## The labs focus on device drivers topics and they resemble “howto” style documentation. Each topic has two parts:
* a walk-through the topic which contains an overview, the main abstractions, simple examples and pointers to APIs
* a hands-on part which contains a few exercises that should be resolved by the student; to focus on the topic at hand, the student is presented with a starting coding skeleton and with in-depth tips on how to solve the exercises
